Below is a Python file. Analyze it for potential performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements.  Focus on:

- Efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Reducing unnecessary computations.
- Optimizing loops and iterations.
- Using appropriate libraries for performance-critical tasks.
- Do NOT change the existing functionality.

If you identify any bottlenecks, modify the code to improve performance. If you make changes, explain the changes and their expected impact. If no performance improvements are identified or if you cannot make a safe improvement, return the original code.
Return ONLY the complete, modified Python code.

```python
{code}
```
