Below is a Python file. Analyze it for potential performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements.  Focus on:

- Efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Reducing unnecessary computations.
- Optimizing loops and iterations.
- Using appropriate libraries for performance-critical tasks.
- Do NOT break any of the existing functionality.

If you identify any bottlenecks, modify the code to improve performance. If no performance improvements are identified or if you cannot make a safe improvement, return the original code.
Return ONLY the complete, modified Python code and nothing before or after.

```python
{code}
