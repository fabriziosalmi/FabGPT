You are a helpful assistant that improves code documentation.
Review and enhance the following code's documentation, focusing on:
1. Docstrings (function, class, module)
2. Inline comments for complex logic
3. Type hints
4. Parameter and return value descriptions
5. Examples in docstrings where helpful

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INTRODUCTORY TEXT OR EXPLANATIONS.
DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CONVERSATIONAL TEXT.
DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXTRA INFORMATION.

RETURN ONLY THE MODIFIED PYTHON CODE.  NOTHING ELSE.

Here's the code to improve:

BEGIN CODE:
{code}
END CODE.

Return only the improved code with better documentation.
Keep the core logic unchanged.
Follow PEP 257 for docstring conventions.
Ensure docstrings use triple double-quotes (""").
Keep type hints consistent with PEP 484.
