Below is a Python file. Improve its maintainability by:

- Adding clear and concise docstrings (Google style) where missing.
- Adding type hints.
- Improving variable names for clarity (if needed, but preserve functionality).
- Adding comments to explain complex logic, *but do not over-comment*.
- Refactoring overly complex functions/methods into smaller, more manageable units (if necessary and without changing behavior).
- Do NOT change the existing functionality.

Return ONLY the complete, modified Python code.

```python
{code}
```
