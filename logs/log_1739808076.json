        "script.py": "- Simplified the proxy logic by removing unnecessary comments and code, which could have been exploited if not properly maintained.\n- Simplified the class structure by removing redundant methods and attributes.\n- Simplified the `TransparentProxy` class by removing redundant comments and unnecessary logging, which can improve performance by reducing I/O operations.\n- Removed unnecessary imports and code, reducing the file size and potential overhead.\n- Refactored the class and methods for better readability.\n- Improved logging configuration by moving it to a more appropriate location.\n- Removed the logging configuration from within the script to prevent potential security risks associated with log file manipulation.\n- Removed unnecessary imports and comments.\n- Simplified the code by removing redundant logging configuration.\n",
        "script2.py": "- Added comments to explain the purpose of each section in the code, such as validating an example file path and creating a simple HTTP server.\n- Updated the example file path to use the safe directory, ensuring that it adheres to the security constraints.\n- Added comments to define a safe base directory for file operations.\n- Removed unnecessary comments and added inline comments for clarity, improving code readability.\n- Modified the `validate_file_path` function to ensure that the resolved file path is within the safe directory, preventing directory traversal attacks.\n- Improved the docstring for `validate_file_path` to clearly state that it checks if the file path exists within a safe directory.\n- Added a `SAFE_BASE_DIR` constant to define a safe directory for file operations.\n- Removed unnecessary comments that were redundant or did not add value to the code understanding.\n- Added a check to ensure the constructed file path is within the `SAFE_BASE_DIR`, preventing directory traversal attacks.\n- Updated the example file path to use the `SAFE_BASE_DIR`, ensuring it adheres to the new security measure.\n- Used `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.join` to construct the local file path, ensuring that paths are handled correctly and securely.\n- Removed unnecessary comments and whitespace, improving code readability without affecting performance.\n- Added a `SAFE_BASE_DIR` constant to define a safe directory for file operations, enhancing security by restricting file access to a predefined path.\n- Added a `SAFE_BASE_DIR` constant to define a safe directory for file operations, enhancing security.\n- Modified the `validate_file_path` function to ensure that any file path is within the safe directory, enhancing security by preventing access to arbitrary files.\n- Used triple quotes for docstrings consistently.\n"
